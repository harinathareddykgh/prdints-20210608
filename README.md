You will find all projects we created during the class with all exercises applied to the corresponding projects.  You will find additional project, such as the `mutual-tls` project that are not part of the class material but very important in illustrating both sides of mutual TLS.

The `cheatsheet.txt` file that I used to get my queues while going through the class is at the root of this repo--keep in mind, this is there to help me remember dificult commands to write from scratch and to help me remember what is coming next in the class; as such it is very spartan and lean.

All screenshots I took while we were advancing through the class can be found under the `screenshots` folder.

My `settings.xml` file along with the parent `pom.xml` we created in order facilitate the creation of the custom policy can also be found at the root of this repository.

**NOTE**: This repo will be removed in about a week.  Please download all that you need.
